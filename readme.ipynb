    "## Find Lane Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.\n",
    "* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.\n",
    "* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.\n",
    "* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image (\"birds-eye view\").\n",
    "* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.\n",
    "* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.\n",
    "* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.\n",

    "\n",
    "The code for this step is contained  cell of the IPython notebook located in \"./examples/example.ipynb\" (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calibrate the i need to collect object points in real world and image points that are the projection into the 2D image from the camera\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read a calibration images\n",
    "* Get chessboard points on each image and save it into the image points array\n",
    "* Calibrate camera\n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: \n",

    "### Color transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The code of this part is in `./src/gradient.py` in the `executePipeline()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to simplify the image to detect line lanes on the image I have to filter the image and reduce it to a binary image black/white.\n",
    "\n",
    "I choose the HLS color space and in particular the L and the S channels to extract the binary image.\n",
    "In this process I use the Sobel filter using `cv2.Soblel()` function, this will calculate a gradient value for each pixel that increase where pixels are parts of straight line, vertical or horizontal depends on the direction values paramters of the sobel function.\n",

    "\n",
    "The lane search starts with the binary image transformed into bird's eye view, on this image I start to find the lanes X position by extracting histogram based on the number of white pixels per column this give me the chance to find two high values on the image and get the X in the middle of each lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each value I define a rectangle where the width is 2x the `margin` value and the height is caluculated by a number of windows I'll create (`nwindows` property in the code). For each rectagle I select and store useful white pixels and for each rectangle I recalculate the mean on x positions of the pixels for the next. To avoid casual pixels cause a a large movement I recalculate the mean only if the number of pixels in the rectagle are grater than `minpix` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sliding window\n",
    "![Sliding window][sliding_window]\n",
    "\n",
    "The code of this part is in `./src/line.py` in the `get_line()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all \"good pixels\" I can calculate a line that fit all pixels using the `polyfit` function of the numpy library.\n",
    "Note that the `polyfit` function returns the three coefficients of a second order polynomial for the following form:  $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ but I already have the Y values because are each pixel in vertical direction `np.linspace(0, height-1, height )` so I chose to invert X and Y pixels parameters of the `polyfit` functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the slinding windows process that use a lot of time to execute in a video where lanes in frames are similar I use the line calculated in the first frame to find \"good pixels\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measure curvature \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the line coefficients I could calculate the the curvature of the line transformed to tbe real world. To do that I use this formula $\\frac{(1+(2*A*y + B)^2)^\\frac{3}{2}}{|2*B|}$ where `y` should be multiplied to a coefficient that in my case is $\\frac{44}{100}$. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Project Video\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end I use the detector class to draw lane lines onto a video, frame by frame. To make more smooth the changes over frames I use the average coeffiecients between previous frames and the new one. \n",
    "Sometimes in a frame it's impossibile to find the lane due to an incorrect gradients filter, in this cases the `line` class returns the average of the previous lines. If I lost lanes for more than 5 frames I ask for a reset and the `detector` class redo a sliding window process.\n",

    "## Conclusions and improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "The project took me a lot of time for trial and errors and some time for the knowledge that I had to refresh. But I think the code will work for simple videos. Here I want to explain some improvments that I choose to not implement for time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Color channels\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried a lot of color spaces and operetiosn between them to reduce the noise of the image and increase edge detection. I think this is part could be majorly improved than others.\n",
    "- Using the Red channel of RGB it's possibile to get more details and well definde edges\n",
    "- Another improvments could be do some operation between H and S channels (in the HLS color space) because in the H channel the lanes are most of the time black.\n"
